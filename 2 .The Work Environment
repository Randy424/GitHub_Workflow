Optimally, we want to write and test our code with Android studio and submit our changes to that code using Gitkracken.
And this can be accomplished pretty simply (intially you want to make sure you already have a github account, that
you have access to our hackFSU repo, that you have Android Studio installed and that you have forked that repo onto your account):

NOW,
  1. Download & install GitHub for Desktop (there are a few reasons for this step--I'll get to them shortly)
  
  2. Sign into your github account in the desktop app and clone your forked repository onto your computer (this will be your 'local' repo).
  
  3. Download & install Gitkraken. Make sure to sign into the app with your Github and to provide your name and profile name in profile
     settings. 
     
  4. Open your local repo with Gitkraken. (That earlier mentioned reason: It's important that local repo is downloaded intially by Github
     for Desktop-- GitKraken will rely on the .git folder that the app provides its repo's.) Once the repo is open you should be able see  
     the history of the code. More importantly, you should be able to see the "remote" repo that this clone correponds to (your forked 
     repo on github) should be visible under the "remote" tab in GitKraken. 
     
  5. Finally, simply open the local repository with Android studio. The app will likely ask to build a project directory (this is fine). 
     
    If you find that Android studio cannot find "git.exe", you should be able to find it in the GitHubDesktop program directory 
    (if you're using windows it will look something like "C:\Users\*your_user_name*\AppData\Local\GitHubDesktop\app-1.0.4\resources\app")
    That also happens to be the second reason we are downloading GitHubDesktop. For whatever reason, the GitKraken and Android studio apps
    seem to have a conflict involving git.exe. This is work-around. 
     
   And that is basically the short of our setup.
