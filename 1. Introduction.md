Some Guidelines for managing our work in the Android repo


I want to begin by mentioning some issues we've been continually running in our first real project involving version control: 


1. Optimizing our work environment (Github-GitKraken-GitHub Desktop)
    i. The process by which we submit our commits, test new code, and manage our versions.  
    ii. Getting Andriod studio and GitKraken to work along side each other has been tricky. I have found a solutioin to this.  


2. Learning from and developing on the code simulatneously.
      i. This has been leading to errors or bugs in our (or your local) repo (not necessarily a bad thing, you have to fail sometimes to            learn; it is however something that needs to be managed strictly). This is pretty closely realted to the previous issue.
    
3. Making real progress
    i. Seeing issues as assignments; tackling them head on. 
    
    
  Each of these issues will be addressed at lenght in my next few posts. We will be using those documents to guide our work from hence forward.
