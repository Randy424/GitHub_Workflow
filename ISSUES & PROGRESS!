We want to treat issues as open assignments. HackFSU dev team is fairly hands-off when it comes to how we go about completing our work. What is of central importance really is our dedication to the timeline set forward by the team. This is where issues, sprints and milestones come in. 

We will be using these features to manage our deadlines.

Issues essentially describe a problem or expectation yet fullfilled within our code.
Sprints are designated periods of time (usually a week) to tackle those issues head on. 
Milestones are feature based goals for our code *at large*


IT IS IMPERATIVE, that you are proactive with the work you take on. If you are a part of the dev team you should always have something you're working on.

SO, make sure to state what issue you aim to work on (either via "assign" or by commenting under the issue). 

ALSO, try to keep an eye on where your peers are on their projects via slack. You could both be facing the same issue with your code and not even know it!

NEVER be afraid to ask for help from your peers. We all are working towards the same goal!
